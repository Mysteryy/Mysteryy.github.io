# Waterfall
**Best For**: Projects with well-defined requirements and little expected change.  
**Pros**: Easy to manage, clear milestones, and structured documentation.  
**Cons**: Limited flexibility, changes are costly and time-consuming, delayed feedback.
**Approach**: Sequential and linear; follows a fixed plan from start to finish.  


## Key Phases:  
  * **Requirements**: Thoroughly gathered and documented at the start.  
  * **Design**: Detailed design is created based on finalized requirements.  
  * **Development**: Coding phase follows after the design is complete.  
  * **Testing**: Testing occurs only after development is finished.  
  * **Deployment**: Final product is deployed once all testing is complete.  
  * **Maintenance**: Post-deployment phase includes bug fixes and minor updates.  

## Waterfall Vs. Agile

| Feature | Agile | Waterfall |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Adaptability** | High, flexible to change | Low, changes are difficult |
| **Project Size** | Best for medium to large | Best for small to medium |
| **Customer Involvement** | Continuous interaction | Initial and final phases |
| **Testing** | Ongoing, within each iteration | At the end of development |
| **Documentation** | Lightweight, as needed | Comprehensive upfront |
| **Delivery** | Incremental | One-time final delivery |
