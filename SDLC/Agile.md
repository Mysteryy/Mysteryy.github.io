# Agile
**Best For**: Projects with evolving requirements, where quick adaptation to change is essential.  
**Pros**: High flexibility, customer satisfaction, faster delivery of functional software.  
**Cons**: Requires constant involvement from stakeholders; can lead to scope creep

## Agile Manifesto

### 4 Values

1. Value individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
2. Value working software over comprehensive documentation  
3. Value customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
4. Value responding to change over following a plan

### 12 Principles

1. Satisfy the customer  
2. Welcome change  
3. Deliver SW frequently  
4. Work Together  
5. Motivate Individuals  
6. Use face to face communication  
7. Working software \= progress  
8. Constant pace  
9. Technical excellence  
10. Simplicity  
11. Self organizing teams  
12. Reflection

## Key Phases (In a Single Sprint Cycle):  
  1. **Planning & Requirements**: Gathered and refined throughout each iteration  
  2. **Design & Development**: Continuous development within short cycles (typically 1-4 weeks).  
  3. **Testing**: Integrated within each iteration, allowing for quick feedback and adaptation.  
  4. **Deployment**: Frequently deployed or released in increments.  
  5. **Review & Retrospective**: End-of-sprint reviews with stakeholders and team retrospectives for improvement.  



## Waterfall Vs. Agile

| **Project Size** | Best for medium to large | Best for small to medium |
| **Customer Involvement** | Continuous interaction | Initial and final phases |
| **Testing** | Ongoing, within each iteration | At the end of development |
| **Documentation** | Lightweight, as needed | Comprehensive upfront |
| **Delivery** | Incremental | One-time final delivery |
