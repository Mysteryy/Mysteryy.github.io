# Technical Question Examples
Below are some real questions that were asked during technical, or non-technical interviews, 
focused on technical related questions. The focus for this list is not on writing code type questions,
but instead on **verbal** technical questions where you need to verbally respond. 

This could be "tell me a time" type questions, theoretical architecture, language specific questions,
or things of that nature. The exact wording is paraphrased but conveys the same meaning. 

In my experience, the expectation is that you will give a comprehensive explanation 
related to the question, keeping it as concise and relevant as possible. In these interviews, you need
to gauge your interviewers based on questions they ask, their expressions, and tone, and use
that as a guide to judge how in depth to go.

Focus on "I" and not "We". 
For example:

"We developed a backend using..."   ->   "I developed service A for a backend using..."
